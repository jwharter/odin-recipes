          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>If you think of iconic American tacos, the crispy taco what most often comes to mind. This style, which also goes by the name of hard-shell tacos or crunchy tacos, is defined by the corn tortilla fried into a U shape, then stuffed with meat, lettuce, tomatoes, and cheese. While fast-food renditions and prefabricated tortilla shells have given it a bad reputation, when prepared with love and with care, the classic crispy taco is a Tex-Mex joy.</p>
